= Setting up mocks to help with parallel development

Now that the OpenAPI specs are finalised, creation of API mocks will enable parallel development streams leading to rapid inner loop development. 

* The various  dev teams (such as mobile dev) do not need to wait for the APIs to be completely developed and instead can use these mocks to get realistic responses. 
* Backend developers in parallel build the backend applications APIs using modern cloud-native frameworks such as https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^, window=product-page]. 

There are a number of ways to mock APIs including microcks, postman etc. In this module, you will use Microcks which has been deployed on OpenShift already.

== Goals of this lab
* Import the Product Catalog API from Service Registry 
* Test the imported API using the mock server and look for the change made to one of the examples in the API Designer


== Import the Product Catalog API

[NOTE]

Microcks has been set up in dev-mode within OpenShift globex-apim-%USERID% namespace. 


. Launch https://microcks-globex-apim-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%/[microcks^] 
+
[NOTE]
====
Microcks has been setup in developer-mode without authentication only for the purpose of this workshop. You can access the deployment from the link:https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/topology/ns/globex-apim-%USERID%?view=graph[OpenShift Console^,role=external,window=console]. If required, login with your username and password (`%USERID%/openshift`). 
====
. Click on the *Importers* button as show in the screenshot below
+

. You will be presented with the *Import Jobs* page. Click *+Create* button.
+

. In the *Create a new Job* wizard - *Step 1: Importer Job properties*, fill in the following details as shown in the screenshot below, and click *Next>* button. +
* *Name*: 
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
Product Catalog
----
* *Repository URL*: 
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
https://service-registry-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%/apis/registry/v2/groups/globex/artifacts/ProductCatalogAPI

[NOTE]
====
The Repository URL that you provided is the OpenAPI Schema's URL from Service Registry that you setup in the previous step. 
====
. Since there is no Authentication secret to be provided, click *Next >* in *Step 2 - Authentication options*
+
image:mic-create-job-step2.png[] 
. You can choose to provide a label in the *Labels* step. But since this is not mandatory or relevant to this exercise, you can simply choose to click *Next >* in the *Step 3 - Labels*
image:mic-create-job-step3.png[] 
. Click *Create* in the *Step 4 - Review* step of this wizard 
image:mic-create-job-step4.png[] 
. You would be able to view the Product Catalog API that you imported being listed as shown below. Take special note of the labels as highlighted. If you see an *Error* label, refer to the note shown below
+

+
[CAUTION]
====
image:mic-import-error.png[] 
If there is an error in fetching the content, this could mean that you had provided a different name to the schema within Service Registry other than *ProductCatalogAPI*
====
. Navigate to the *APIs | Services* to view the API that has been successfully imported. Click on *Product Catalog API* link (highlighted in the screenshot below)
+
image:mic-view-api.png[] 
. View the details of the imported Product Catalog
. Click on the arrow *>* against the first operation *GET /services/product/list/{ids}* to view the details of this operation. 
** You may note that this operation holds the example that you had edited to include your name :)
+
image:mic-view-api-details.png[] 
. You will now be able to see the Mock URL, the response code and other details for this specific operation
. Copy the Mock URL by clicking on the *Copy icon* shown in the Mock tab named *product-list-with-inventory*. Refer to the screenshot below.
+
[CAUTION]
====
The order in which the Mocks are displayed could be different from the screenshot. So ensure you are choosing *product-list-with-inventory* and not the *product-list-without-inventory*
====
+

. Open a new browser tab, and navigate to the Mock URL you copied in the above step.
. You can view the list of products from the example of the Mock. Note that the name of the Quarkus T-shirt now says `Jaya's Awesome Quarkus T-shirt` (or the name you have for this product)
+
image:mic-final-mock.png[] 
. These mock end points of the mock server can be used by the dev teams that are dependent on the APIs, to continue development in parallel without having to wait for the backend services to be fully developed, thereby accelerating time to market.


Go ahead and close all the other browser tabs but this Instructions browser tab you are viewing. +
In the next step, you will learn to protect the API by using Red Hat 3scale API Management.
