== Globex's Digital Transformation Journey

Globex, a fictitious retail company, has recently started a digital transformation and cloud adoption journey. As part of this initiative, the development and devops teams have completed the modernization of their existing retail e-commerce web application. 

A schematic overview of the current state of the application after the first phase of the application modernization effort:

Taking advantage of this new momentum, the business comes up with new requirements for the e-commerce application including 

* Multi-channel approach which includes a mobile application in addition to the retail web-site. 
* The ability to track user activity on various channels
* Highlight products which generate most customer interest as featured products.

=== Challenges

There are however a number of challenges with the new requirements

* Adding new channels remains difficult, with a high risk of tight coupling to the existing services
* Managing, securing and governance to allow access for external partners and development teams
* Adoption of new technologies requires time and new skills, which are not readily available inside the company.

=== Solution Approach
In order to cope with these challenges,  +

* The team decides to adopt an *API First approach* for rapid development across teams
* Since Globex does not want to allow direct access to the backend API services to external channels, access is only allowed through an API Management platform. 
* A preference for *managed cloud services* for an easy and rapid adoption of new middleware components, which allows the teams to focus on the business requirements, without the need to invest in skills and infrastructure to deploy and maintain these components.

== Goals of this lab
In this module you will follow this journey:

* *Design* an API resulting in an OpenAPI schema
* Host this OpenAPI schema in a *registry* for use by various teams
* *Mock* the APIs to enable faster inner loop development
* *Manage and secure* APIs to allow access for external teams
