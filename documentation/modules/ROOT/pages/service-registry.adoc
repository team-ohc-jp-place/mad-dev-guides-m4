= Publish, discover, and reuse artifacts with Red Hat build of Apicurio Registry

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_build_of_apicurio_registry[Red Hat build of Apicurio Registry^, window=_blank] is a datastore for sharing standard event schemas and API designs across event-driven and API architectures. 

== Goals of this lab
* Import the OpenAPI Spec into Service Registry
* Enable Content Rules to test OpenAPI format validity

== Launch Service Registry

. Launch *Service Registry* by accessing https://service-registry-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%/ui/[Service Registry^, window="service_registry_url"]

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat build of Apicurio Registry has been set up within OpenShift *globex-apim-%USERID%* namespace. You can access the deployment from the link:https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/topology/ns/globex-apim-%USERID%?view=graph[OpenShift Console^,role=external,window=console], and if required login with(`%USERID%/openshift`). 
====
. Click on the *Upload artifact* button as shown in the above screenshot. You will be presented with a *Upload Artifact* wizard 
+

. In the wizard, enter the following details, and click on the *Upload* button. 
.. Use the exact same values as instructed below to avoid errors in the other sections of this module.
+
- *Group*: `globex`
- *ID of the artifact*: `ProductCatalogAPI`
- *Artifact textarea*: Click on *Browse..* button to upload the Product Catalog OpenAPI downloaded in the previous step, or `Drag & drop` the file into the textarea.
.. Click the *Upload* button

[NOTE]
====
* This OpenAPI schema can be easily shared with others through the https://service-registry-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%/apis/registry/v2/groups/globex/artifacts/ProductCatalogAPI[OpenAPI Schema's endpoint^].
* This schema can be used for generating client SDK as well by clicking on the *Generate client SDK* link that can be seen in the screenshot above.
====

. Click on the *Documentation* tab to view the OpenAPI specifications 
. Click on the *Content* tab to view the schema in JSON format

== Enabling Artifact-specific rules for format validity
. Navigate back to the *Overview* tab.

. Observe the *Artifact-specific rules* section which provides options to validate the schema and enforce compatibility while the artifact is updated.
+

. Click on *Enable* button (highlighted in the above screenshot) for *Validity rule* and choose *Full* from the dropdown. This rule ensures that the content is valid when the artifact is updated.
+

. Click on the *Content* tab. Copy the entire content of the artifact shown in this tab into the memory with `Ctrl+A` and `Ctrl+C`.
+

. Click on the *Upload new version* button on the top-right of the page, and paste the content of the schema that you copied in the previous steps into the textbox provided with `Ctrl+V`. 
+

. Delete the closing `}` at the bottom of the text box and click *Upload*.
+
* The original content:

* After introducing an error:
+
image::sr-edit-schema-with-error.png[]

. You will observe an `*Invalid Content Error*` stating that one of the content rules has been violated, and displaying details of the error. The artifact's content is not updated.
+

. Click on `Close` to dismiss the error.

[NOTE]
====
In real-life, the content rules are very helpful when APIs are used to manage Service Registry schema updates.
