In this module you will discover how an API First Approach provides the right framework to build microservices and APIs based systems. The stages of an API life cycle cover both the implementation life cycle and the management life cycle.


## Key Takeaways

* API First approach to design, host schema, mock APIs to  allows parallel streams of development between API implementers and API consumers.
* The introduction of an API Management solution (Red Hat 3scale API management) to expose, secure and manage the APIs to the application backend services. 

## Technology Stack

* Red Hat 3scale API Management
* Red Hat build of Quarkus
* Red Hat API Designer
* Red Hat build of Apicurio Registry
* Microcks


## Documentation

This workshop is based on link:https://antora.org/[Antora] and link:https://github.com/redhat-scholars/courseware-template[Red Hat scholars template] to build HTML based tutorials.


### Lab Parameters

This lab supports both link:site.yml#L17[Antora variables] than query parameters. Query params makes the workshop content dynamic, like URLs specific for your cluster to copy and paste.

NOTE: In the table above, CRC and Playground links use them.

Here's the list of all query params used (they are all optional, but generated links won't work unless at least `CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN` is set):

[%header,cols=2*] 
|===
|PARAM
|Description

|`USERID`
| The username of your OpenShift cluster

|`SUBDOMAIN`
|The subdomain for your OpenShift cluster in the form `apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, e.g. `apps.openshift.mydomain.tld`
